    "- **Redundancy**: are you copy/pasting the same lines of code over and over? Do you need to process different variables in the same way?\n",
    "- **Same functionality in different places**: Are you doing the similar calculations in different branches of a logic tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionalizing code has several advantages:\n",
    "1. **Increase flexibility**: allows you to \"toggle\" behaviors on and off, avoid hardcoding literal values\n",
    "2. **Increase testability**: clarify which part of the code should be responsible for specific task\n",
    "3. **Increase readability**: named functions with docstrings clarify inputs/outputs and the overall code flow\n",
    "4. **Increase reusability**: reuse code in different places without having to copy/paste or manually change variable names\n",
    "5. **Decrease complexity**: bugs are less likely to occur when code is simple and easy to read!\n"
